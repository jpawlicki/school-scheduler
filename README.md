*To organize the schedule is to organize the school.*

This is a tool for organizing class / bell schedules in an educational setting.
It is intended to be useful for administrators in American K-12 school systems.

The tool is intended to be easy to use - just enter your courses (or load a
preset) and you can start scheduling right away. The more it knows about your
school's situation, the more it can help define a schedule that meets your
specific needs: if you fill out what staff and classrooms you have available,
the tool can make sure no person or room is double-booked. And if you add a few
example students, the tool can help you make sure that you prevent or minimize
students who can't follow their expected tracks due to scheduling conflicts.
